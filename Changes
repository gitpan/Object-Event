Revision history for Object-Event:

1.1     Sun Aug  9 18:05:08 CEST 2009
        - fixed some really wrong documentation (i.e.: about return values of
          the event method).
        - added init method for cases where you can't use the Object::Event
          constructor.
        - testing for undefined $self in the guard destructor.
        - added 'handles' method to query whether handlers exist.
        - made the 'event' method return true or false in case
          handlers ran.

1.0     Mon Mar 16 21:23:02 CET 2009
        - added stop/continue feature.
        - deprecated forward feature.
          (will be kept until AnyEvent::XMPP 0.4 is replaced by the new
           AnyEvent::XMPP, in around 1 year probably.)
        - added support for arbitrary priorities.
        - added syntactic sugar for using method calling syntax
          as event invocation.

0.7     Wed Feb 18 11:56:40 CET 2009
        NOTE: This is the last release which will contain the add_forward
        feature. The next release will contain some minor incompatible changes.

        - added unreg_my_set method.
        - fixed bug in _while_referenced implementation
          and added tests (by Pedro Melo)
        - some more tests.
        - added ::Methods syntactic sugar. Please note that the next
          version might contain some incompatible changes here.

0.6     Tue Sep 23 15:13:23 CEST 2008
        - recursive event calling now also should work properly.

0.4     Tue Apr 15 12:48:11 CEST 2008
        - events can now be registered from within the
          callbacks for the same object and event safely.

        - fixed a serious bug in stop_event

0.2     Fri Mar 21 01:38:12 CET 2008
        - forgot a simple test for the event handling
        - added an example
